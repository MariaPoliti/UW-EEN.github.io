Stuart earned his B.S.E. from the Universiy of Michigan in 1987. He then moved to the University of California at Berkeley to earn Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering in 1993 under advisement of Jeffrey A. Reimer, where he used high-temperature nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to study electrochemical ceramics.
He continued his work in ionic materials at Imperial College London (NATO-NSF Fellow), where he developed continuum mechanical theories for high-temperature electrodes. 

Upon rejoining academia in 1999, Stuart began his research group at Case Western Reserve Univeristy before moving to the Univeristy of Washington in 2002.
