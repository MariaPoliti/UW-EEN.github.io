# Abstract 

Porous La1−xSrxCoO3− LSC electrodes having Sr composition x = 0.4 LSC-64 and x = 0.2 LSC-82 were fabricated on
Sm-doped ceria electrolytes, and studied using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy between T = 650–750°C and pO2
= 0.01–1.0 atm. The faradaic portion of the impedance was found to exhibit Gerischer or Gerischer-like characteristics, indicating
colimitation by kinetics and transport. The characteristic resistance and frequency response was analyzed using a transport and
reaction model that considers parallel bulk and surface diffusion of oxygen, as well as three-dimensional transport effects near the
electrode electrolyte interface. In the case of LSC-64, measured characteristics appear to be largely consistent with a bulk transport
path, based on independent measurements of the thermodynamic, kinetic, and transport properties of LSC-64. In the case of
LSC-82, which has a much lower bulk vacancy concentration under the same conditions, results were inconsistent with an entirely
bulk transport path. Results for LSC-82 could be rationalized assuming a parallel surface transport path, where surface mobility is
governed by some kind of interstitial or adatom diffusion mechanism.
